Welcome aboard to the source code of my future-releasing porfolio!




## Code Dependencies
This is not only about the dependencies but all I used to bring this up :)
* Angular 5
* Stylus
* Boostrap 4 Alpha

## Website Structure
The site follows the following structure, this is not the modules/directives structure but the navigation organization that the user follows

* Home
	* Developer

            What tools and lenguages I work in

	* Designer / My Works

			Showcase of my works, in all of these I have worked as the main designer as well in some as the developer

	* Meet Me / The CV

			I don't say I'm Batman, but nobody has seen Batman and I in the same room

	* Own Projects

			Ideas I came up with or I wanted to dig in

	* Legal

			What do you agree upon on using the site, what I have claimed from other users and all the assets created and needed to make this site possible

## Dessign Assets

I want all the process and effort put into this site to be open and available to anyone that want to give it a glance (or even use it), so the Sketch file, vectors and raw images will lay around to be download.
